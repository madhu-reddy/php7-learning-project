include: This will try to find and include the specified file each time it is invoked. If the file is not found, PHP will throw a warning, but will continue with the execution.
require: This will do the same as include, but PHP will throw an error instead of a warning if the file is not found.
include_once: This function will do what include does, but it will include the file only the first time that it is invoked. Subsequent calls will be ignored.
require_once: This works the same as require, but it will include the file only the first time that it is invoked. Subsequent calls will be ignored.

Each function has its own usage, so it is not right to say that one is better than the other. 
Just think carefully what your scenario is, and then decide.
For example, let's try to include our index.html file from our index.php file such that we do not mix PHP with HTML, but have the best of both worlds:

<?php
echo 'hello world';
require 'index.html';
We chose require as we know the file is thereâ€”and if it is not, we are not interested in continuing the execution. 
Moreover, as it is some HTML code, we might want to include it multiple times, so we did not choose the require_once option
