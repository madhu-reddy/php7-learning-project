Exception Handling in PHP
An exception is unexpected program result that can be handled by the program itself. Exception Handling in PHP is almost similar to exception handling in all programming languages.
PHP provides following specialized keywords for this purpose.

try: It represent block of code in which exception can arise.
catch: It represent block of code that will be executed when a particular exception has been thrown.
throw: It is used to throw an exception. It is also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesnâ€™t handle itself.
finally: It is used in place of catch block or after catch block basically it is put for cleanup activity in PHP code.
