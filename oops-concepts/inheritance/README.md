1) Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

2) The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

3) An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

Example Explained
The Strawberry class is inherited from the Fruit class.

This means that the Strawberry class can use the public $name and $color properties as well as the public __construct() and intro() methods from the Fruit class because of inheritance.

The Strawberry class also has its own method: message().
