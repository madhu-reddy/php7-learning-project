```
Polymorphism is an OOP feature that allows us to work with different classes that implement the same interface. It is one of the beauties of object-oriented programming.
```
```
Polymorphism is essentially an OOP pattern that enables numerous classes with different functionalities to execute or share a commonInterface.
```
```
Interface An interface is similar to a class except that it cannot contain code. An interface can define method names and arguments, but not the contents of the methods. Any classes executing an interface must execute all methods characterized by the interface.
